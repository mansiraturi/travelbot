## Overview

Atlas AI transforms travel planning from a fragmented multi-website experience into a single, intelligent conversation. Using LangGraph's multi-agent architecture, the system orchestrates real-time API calls to provide live flight schedules, hotel pricing, and attraction data while maintaining sophisticated state management throughout the planning process.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: 8 specialized agents handle different aspects of travel planning
- **Real API Integration**: Live data from AviationStack, Booking.com, and Google Places
- **Intelligent Validation**: Progressive information collection with natural language processing
- **Adaptive Workflows**: Users can customize their experience or skip to quick results
- **Memory Persistence**: Full conversation context maintained across all interactions
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive fallback systems for API failures

## Multi-Agent Workflow

### Agent Architecture

The system employs 8 specialized agents working in coordination:

1. **Information Extraction Agent** - Parses natural language input and extracts travel requirements
2. **Missing Information Handler** - Collects incomplete data through targeted questioning
3. **Flight Search Agent** - Integrates with AviationStack for real flight schedules
4. **Hotel Search Agent** - Retrieves live hotel pricing from Booking.com via RapidAPI
5. **Attractions Discovery Agent** - Finds real points of interest using Google Places
6. **Style Decision Agent** - Routes users between customization and quick completion
7. **Style Selection Agent** - Handles travel style preferences (Cultural, Adventure, etc.)
8. **Itinerary Creation Agent** - Synthesizes all data into comprehensive travel plans
